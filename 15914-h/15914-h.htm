<h3>FREE ONCE MORE.</h3>

<p>At the close of our fiscal year in 1887, we were enabled to utter the joyful
word "Free," no <i>debt</i> darkening our balance sheet. Last year (1888)
we were compelled to moderate our tone and say "Not quite free," for a
balance of $5,641.21 stood on the wrong side of our ledger. But now, in
the good providence of God, we can say "Free once more."</p>

<p>Our receipts from all sources were $376,216.88; payments, including
debt of last year, $371,745.21, leaving a credit balance of $4,471.67. For
this good result we are in some measure indebted to legacies. But, under
all circumstances, we rejoice in the past and look forward with hope to
the future. The work we have in hand, with its grand results, as will be
seen in the "General Survey" published in this number of the MISSIONARY,
will encourage our friends, and the call there made for growth and enlargement,
will, we are sure, stimulate them to increased contributions and more
earnest prayer. The "Survey" will also contain a statement of the income
and expenditure of the Hand Fund.</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.</h3>

<p>The gathering of this representative body of the Congregational
churches of this country was the largest ever held. It grappled more
fully than any of its predecessors had done with great questions touching the
missionary and benevolent societies in their relations to the churches and to
each other, and the consolidation of the missionary magazines. The most
exciting topic discussed was that of the Georgia Congregational Churches,
white and colored. The result reached on this point was that the representatives
of two District Conferences were enrolled, and that the representative
of the United Congregational Conference of Georgia was given a seat
as an honorary member.</p>

<hr />
<a name="page302" id="page302"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 302]</span>


<h3>THE COLORED DELEGATES.</h3>

<p>The Southern Associations were represented by six colored delegates in
the National Council. Their bearing and ability won the respect and admiration
of the whole Council. They were modest and manly in their deportment,
prudent in their counsels and very eloquent in their speech.
They showed themselves to be the peers of their white brethren, and demonstrated
beyond a question the capacity of the colored man for the highest
intellectual and moral training. They were a credit to the American Missionary
Association, whose pupils they have been, and were a living and
triumphant vindication of its work at the South.</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE MOHONK CONFERENCE.</h3>

<p>The seventh annual gathering of this Conference, Oct. 2-5, was the
largest ever assembled. Among those present for the first time were Ex-President
Hayes, Gen. O.O. Howard, Gen. John Eaton, Prof. Wayland
and Dr. Wayland. The newspaper press, religious and secular, was very
fully represented; Abbott, Buckley, Dunning, Gilbert, Ward and Wayland
are perhaps best known. The venerable Judge Strong well represented the
law, while the absence of Senator Dawes was sincerely regretted.</p>

<p>A marked feature of the Conference was the presence of Gen. Morgan,
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. For weeks prior to the meeting of the
Conference, rumors had gone abroad that he intended to abolish the "contract
schools"&mdash;that is, schools of the missionary societies which the Government
by a "contract" agrees to assist. Articles had appeared in the newspapers
remonstrating against this course, and it was believed that this topic
would be one of most practical interest in the Conference. The Commissioner
early in the meetings read a paper outlining his plan for the establishment
of Government schools for all Indian children&mdash;the attendance to be
compulsory. The omission of all mention of the "contract schools" in
this paper confirmed the impression to which rumor had given currency.
An animated discussion followed the reading of his paper, in which the
Commissioner freely participated. It appeared that he had been misunderstood&mdash;at
least in so far as any immediate curtailment of the "contract
schools" is concerned, and he impressed the Conference warmly in his favor
as a Christian man with broad views, impartial and progressive. He will
meet, we feel sure, with the cordial support of all the societies engaged in
Indian educational work.</p>

<p>The final action of the Conference was embodied in a platform substantially
repeating the utterances of last year, urging national education for
all Indian children and approving the continuance of "contract schools."
Other planks of the platform related to lands in severalty, to the legal rights
of the Indians, etc.&mdash;all of which were unanimously approved, and thus
<a name="page303" id="page303"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 303]</span>
once more this remarkable Conference followed its predecessors in free and
frank debate, consummated by entire harmony in the result.</p>

<p>The varied and unique scenery of Lake Mohonk was shown at its best
by three days of bright and bracing weather. The welcome of Mr. and
Mrs. Smiley to their increased number of guests, who taxed to the utmost
limits the accommodations of the large establishment, was as cordial and
genial as ever. The hearty and enthusiastic vote of thanks, the only compensation
permitted, was a far less reward than the gratification of their own
benevolent feelings in doing good; and that gratification is probably to be
enhanced by the calling together of another Conference in the early summer
in behalf of a still larger class of our needy fellow-citizens than the Indians.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>A good friend of the American Missionary Association in a New England
village recently greatly stirred up the interest of the people in behalf
of our work, through a missionary society which she organized among the
children. They had meetings for sewing, preparing articles for a box, and
then a fair, in which they sold other articles that they had made, out of
which they gathered a considerable sum of money. The interest went far
beyond the children. A gentleman, not a member of the church, who
had never been interested in missionary work, was stirred up by the solicitation
of the children, and gave both time and money to their effort. He
afterwards said to a good lady who inaugurated the movement, "I am glad
I have given to this cause; it makes me feel good, and I want to keep right
on giving." That is the way it affects every one when the heart and pocket-book
are open to these missionary objects. It makes them feel good, and
stirs up a desire to continue the process.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Christian Endeavor Societies of New England are assisting nobly
in the work of the American Missionary Association. One society pledges
itself to support a missionary in our field for a year. Another makes one of
its number a Life Member of our Association, contributing thirty dollars.
Still another brings in a handsome collection recently taken, and still another
devotes the prayer meeting evening to thorough study upon the work that
is being done through the A.M.A., in the needy and destitute portions of
our country. One young man who spoke at the last meeting spent a portion
of his vacation in studying up the work among the Highlanders of the
South, and gave the results of his study at their meeting. And why should
not this active society of earnest young people be interested in the great
work that is being accomplished among other young people, painfully in
want of the advantages which those here enjoy? A prayer meeting pledge
of the Y.P.S.C.E., printed in the Sioux language by Indian boys at a
<a name="page304" id="page304"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 304]</span>
Santee school, is a most interesting evidence that this society is not confined
in its usefulness to any locality or race. A vigorous Society is one of
the elements of work in this Indian school, and a most useful element. In
a letter written by an Indian boy is the following: "We have a Christian
Endeavor Society here. I joined that society not very long ago, and we
have nice meetings on Saturday night. It does make me feel good in those
meetings. There are about thirty members now." And so these Societies
of New England in their prayers for, and contributions to, the work of the
American Missionary Association, are clasping hands with the same societies
among the Negroes, Mountain people and Indians.</p>

<p>The "King's Daughters" are also a useful agency in the field work of
our Association. A little Indian girl writes interestingly of the "King's
Daughters" of whom she is one.</p>

<hr />

<h3>DEATH OF SUPERINTENDENT HALL.</h3>

<p>Just as we are going to press, (October 18th), we are startled by the
telegraphic announcement of the sudden death from typhoid fever of Prof.
Edward S. Hall, one of our Field Superintendents. Mr. Hall had been one
year in the service of the Association, and had already shown himself to be
a man of varied and remarkable capabilities&mdash;not only skilled in the management
of schools, but familiar in an unusual degree with the practical
work of building and repairing school and church edifices. His services
have been invaluable to the Association, and it will be difficult to supply
his place. As a man of noble Christian character and consecration to
the work entrusted to him, he had won our highest esteem.</p>

<hr />

<h3>DEATH OF LARMON B. LANE, M.D.</h3>

<p>Rev. Larmon B. Lane, M.D., died at his home in St. Charles, Ill., Sept.
15, 1889. He was born in Tallmadge, Ohio, June 21, 1821. He studied
medicine at Cleveland Medical College, and afterward attended Oberlin
College and Theological Seminary, graduating in 1848. The following year
he was sent by the American Missionary Association as missionary physician
to Siam, where he labored faithfully, ministering to soul and body six
years. In 1855 a severe hemorrhage compelled him to give up the missionary
work. After a short rest he began his work of preaching the gospel.
He had successful pastorates in Illinois and Ohio; afterwards he practiced
medicine in Geneva and St. Charles, Ill., at which latter place he died.
He was successful as a physician and continued to the end a loyal servant
of Christ, was deacon, treasurer and Sunday-school Superintendent, besides
being always ready to do with his might what his hands found to do.</p>

<h2>FORTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT</h2>

<h4>OF THE</h4>

<h2>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">For The Year Ending September 30th, 1889.</span></h3>

<hr />

<h3>GENERAL SURVEY.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The American Missionary Association finds its commission in the
words of the Master, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature."</p>

<p>It does not choose its fields of labor because the people in them are
black, or red, or yellow, or white; but because they are those for whom
Christ died and to whom he commanded the glad tidings of salvation to be
preached. In the fields to which it providentially has been called, it seeks
to bring the gospel to every human being who has it not in its purity as an
uplifting power.</p>

<p>In nineteen States and Territories we are laboring&mdash;six in the West and
thirteen in the South. In ninety-four schools and one hundred and forty-two
churches we have been directly teaching and preaching the gospel during
the past year. In them have 456 missionaries wrought with holy purpose.
12,132 pupils have been taught in our schools; more than seventeen
thousand have received instruction in Bible truth in our Sunday-schools;
782 conversions have been reported. $3,160.14 have been reported as
given in our mission churches for benevolence, and $21,658.57 for their own
expenses&mdash;again over last year of $660.03 in benevolence and $2,322.62
in church expenses. Besides all this and all that in various ways has failed
to be reported to us, have been the vacation work of our students, the large
work of our previous graduates, the indirect results of many kinds, and the
unknown results and influences of great power and far-reaching importance
which have gone forth from our institutions and missionaries whose only
possible record is in God's Book of Remembrance.</p>

<hr />


<h3>THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p>In the South, we are directly reaching three classes&mdash;the colored people,
the mountain whites, and the new settlers from the North and from the old
countries. Indirectly we are reaching many more. The schools we plant
often incite others to plant schools; the houses of worship we aid in erecting
cause others to be erected. A single neat, but inexpensive building
for a country church of colored people has been known to occasion the
building or repairing of at least nine church buildings of neighboring
white people. The incontestably good results of our work among the
colored people are slowly but surely undermining race prejudice. In spite
<a name="page306" id="page306"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 306]</span>of
all the race trouble during the past year and the increasingly bitter
utterances of some papers and some public speakers, during no other year
in the history of our country have so many manly words in favor of the
Negro been printed in Southern papers, and sounded from the pulpits and
platforms of the South. It was in a Southern University and before a
Southern audience that a Southern man, a Bishop of a Southern church
which took the name Southern when it declared for slavery, this year uttered
these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It is a travesty on religion, this disposition to canonize missionaries
who go to the Dark Continent, while we have nothing but social ostracism
for the white teacher who is doing a work no less noble at home. The solution
to the race problem rests with the white people who live among the
blacks, and who are willing to become their teachers in a missionary
spirit."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Cruel and unreasoning is prejudice, but when the public platforms, and
especially the pulpits, begin to yield in their utterances to the sway of
logic and humanity, by and by public opinion will feel their force. Our institutions
and our missionaries have compelled the respect of the Southern
people. This year many expressions of it have been heard.</p>

<hr />


<h3><i>EDUCATIONAL WORK.</i></h3>

<h4>CHARTERED INSTITUTIONS.</h4>

<p>During the past year we have directly sustained five chartered institutions
in the South&mdash;Fisk University, Talladega College, Tougaloo University,
Straight University and Tillotson Institute. Every year that passes
emphasizes anew that these are most wisely located, so that each is a center
of far-reaching power, and supplements the work of all the others.</p>

<p>Fisk University at Nashville, Tenn., with its 503 students, has had a year
of great prosperity, and solid, telling work. Its buildings have been full,
the quality of the work done has been excellent. A graduate of Fisk
recently took his diploma from an Eastern school of medicine, with a rank
two per cent. higher than any other man in his class. Another graduate
of Fisk is a missionary in Africa under the American Board, and is not only
declared by the Secretaries to be one of its best missionaries, but has shown
such business capacity that he has been chosen treasurer of his mission.
His wife, a worthy helpmeet, is also a graduate of this institution. Fisk
has high ideals&mdash;few institutions in the South have higher ones, or come
nearer reaching them.</p>

<p>Talladega College, in Talladega, Ala., has had 427 students in all departments.
Its year's work has shown most satisfactory results. Talladega
is closely connected with the church work of the State. All the pastors
in the Congregational State Association but four are from its theological
department and several other States have found pastors there. The last
<a name="page307" id="page307"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 307]</span>
State Association, with its fine body of young men, educated, dignified
and earnest, was a most emphatic demonstration of the good work done in
this institution. The students of Talladega have carried forward during
the past year, under direction of a member of the Faculty, a systematic
mission work in the surrounding neighborhoods, which has yielded large results,
both in the good done in the neighborhoods and in the training received
by the workers for future usefulness.</p>

<p>Tougaloo University has been filled to overflowing with 343 students,
and after the last inch of room had been filled, scores had to be turned
away. This school is situated almost in the center of the State, and
reaches a far larger region not limited by State lines. It is near the border
of the Yazoo country, which has begun to be so wondrously developed,
and is so rapidly filling with colored people. The evangelization and
enlightenment of this new Africa must largely come through Tougaloo.
Here must be trained preachers, teachers and other leaders of character
for this new region, as well as for the older portions of the State. Good,
solid work has been done here all through the year, and preparation has
been made for even better results in the future.</p>

<p>Straight University, in New Orleans, La., is peculiarly situated for an
important and far-reaching work. It draws its students not only from the
States, but also from Mexico and the West Indies&mdash;484 last year. With
the enlarged accommodations for the primary and intermediate work which
have been planned, this institution will be better prepared to meet the demands
of higher education.</p>

<p>Tillotson Institute, at Austin, Texas, the youngest of our chartered institutions,
has had a prosperous year with 230 students, in the Primary,
Intermediate, Grammar, Normal, College Preparatory and College departments.
Situated at the capital of the great empire of Texas, it is destined
to be an educational, religious and evangelistic centre, a power for the
building up of the kingdom of Christ. It greatly needs enlarged accommodations.
Where is the Lord's steward who is ready to give it at once
the imperatively needed Girls' Hall?</p>


<h4>NORMAL AND GRADED SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p>Next to our chartered institutions come our normal schools. These
have the same course of study up to the college department as the chartered
institutions have. These normal schools are eighteen in number,
and are situated at Lexington and Williamsburg, Ky.; Memphis, Jonesboro,
Grand View and Pleasant Hill, Tenn.; Wilmington and Beaufort, N.C.;
Charleston and Greenwood, S.C.; Atlanta, Macon, Savannah, Thomasville
and McIntosh, Ga.; Athens, Mobile and Marion, Ala. Adding to
these the normal departments of our five chartered institutions, gives us
twenty-three normal schools in the South.</p>

<p>Besides these, we have in the South thirty-seven which we class as
<a name="page308" id="page308"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 308]</span>
common schools. Eight of these are graded, with two or three teachers
each. Nearly all are parochial schools. The teachers are in both the day
schools and the Sunday-schools, and are not only school teachers, but
church missionaries. They train the young of our congregations for
greater usefulness, encourage many of the most promising to go to higher
institutions, teach the parents better ideas of home life, and lead all ages
to a more intelligent and spiritual worship.</p>


<h4>INDUSTRIAL WORK.</h4>

<p>Nearly all our schools&mdash;chartered, normal and even common&mdash;give
some industrial training.</p>

<p>At Fisk, the young men are taught wood-working and printing; the
young women, nursing, cooking, dress-making and house-keeping.</p>

<p>At Talladega, the young men learn farming, carpentry, painting, glazing,
tinning, blacksmithing and printing; the young women, cooking,
house-keeping, plain sewing and other needle-work.</p>

<p>At Tougaloo, the young men learn farming, carpentry, blacksmithing,
wheelwrighting, painting, turning and tinning; the young women, sewing,
dressmaking, cooking and housekeeping.</p>

<p>At Straight, the young men receive instruction in printing, carpentry,
and floriculture; the young women, needlework, cooking and housekeeping.</p>

<p>At Tillotson, carpentry is taught the young men; needlework, cooking
and housekeeping, the young women.</p>

<p>Our normal schools at Memphis, Tenn., Macon, Ga., and Williamsburg,
Ky., have carpentry, printing, and other industrial training for the young
men, and training in the various arts of home life for the young women.</p>

<p>At Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Macon, Thomasville, Athens, Ala.,
Marion, Mobile, Pleasant Hill, Sherwood, and other normal, graded and
common schools, the young women are trained in the things which they
will most need in making comfortable and pleasant homes. Indeed, we
make it our special care that the girls shall everywhere in our work be
taught these things, so essential to the uplifting of a people. In many
places where we have no schools, the pastor's wife, or our special lady missionary,
is doing this same kind of work.</p>


<h4>THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p>At Fisk, Talladega, Tougaloo and Straight, there have been during the
year theological classes. The Theological Department of Howard University,
at Washington, has been supported by this Association. Even in
some of our normal schools Biblical instruction has been given to some
who are now preachers and some who intend to preach. But the number
trained has not been sufficient to supply our pastorless churches. The
need of a general theological seminary for our churches in the South is
becoming imperative. The extensive enlargement of our church work,
<a name="page309" id="page309"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 309]</span>
which ought to begin at once, can scarcely be made successful without this.
Who is the one to seize this opportunity to establish an institution of
untold possibilities in advancing the Kingdom of Christ on earth&mdash;a place
where ministers shall be prepared for the work in the South and for foreign
missions in Africa?</p>

<h3><i>CHURCH WORK IN THE SOUTH.</i></h3>

<p>Our church work has necessarily been of slow growth. Churches
might have been multiplied, had we thought it best to lower the standard
near the level of the old churches, and acknowledge wild ravings as belonging
in the worship of God. We have believed that our churches should
mean new ideas and intelligent worship. We have knowingly lent our aid
to nothing else.</p>

<p>These churches are gathered into Associations, and the fine bodies of
pastors and delegates which come together in these, present a most emphatic
testimony to the value of the work done in the past, and are an
earnest of what the future will show.</p>

<p>Revivals&mdash;some of them of great power&mdash;have been reported to us
from the Plymouth Church, Washington, D.C., Fisk University, Memphis,
Jonesboro, Sherwood, Glen Mary, Oakdale, Athens and Pine Mountain,
Tenn.; Montgomery and Florence, Ala.; Tougaloo and Jackson, Miss.;
Straight University, New Orleans, and Corpus Christi, Texas. Many others
of our churches have had a quiet work of grace, by which additions have
been made to them.</p>

<p>We report new churches at Glen Mary and Athens, Tenn.; Roseland,
La; Fort Payne and Alco, Ala. This makes the whole number of our
churches in the South 136.</p>

<p>Besides these churches, there are our churches among the Indians and
the work of gathering the Chinese into churches in California.</p>

<p>We are praying and laboring for the eternal salvation of millions, the establishment
through the grace of God, the atoning blood of Christ, and the
<a name="page310" id="page310"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 310]</span>
work of the Holy Spirit, of character which shall meet the tests of the Judgment
Day and the needs of eternal association with purity. In aiming at this
ultimate result, our missionaries are doing a work of inestimable importance
for the nation and the world. They are successfully working upon some
of the great problems of this country, which armies and millions of money
have failed, and of necessity must fail, to solve. Nothing but the "glorious
gospel of the blessed God," taught from the pulpit and the teacher's
desk, and illustrated in the eloquent lives of consecrated missionaries, can
change the idol worshiper from heathen China, the wild-man of the West,
the half-heathen Negro so recently in the cruel degradation of slavery, those
of our own race in the bonds of ignorance and immorality&mdash;so that they
shall have and manifest an intelligent and worthy manhood and womanhood.
Nothing else can meet cruel prejudice, which would forever deny
full manhood or womanhood to those called to it by God himself, and
pour oil upon its angry waves until they shall be still.</p>

<p>Our plan of work in the South is often misunderstood and often misrepresented.
It is not our plan to force the races together. It is not our
plan to agitate questions which arouse the prejudices of the Southern people.
We do not agitate. Quietly, steadily, patiently, lovingly, our missionaries
seek to lift up the degraded, enlighten the ignorant, and bring them
all to Christ, well knowing that bitter prejudice cannot forever stand opposed
to an enlightened, cultivated, Christian people, whatever may be
their color or their past condition. We have nothing to do with the question
of social equality in the South any more than we have in the North.
We are not even trying to force the races together in the churches. We
have no principles which would prevent our aiding two churches in the
same town&mdash;one with a membership of white, the other of colored people.
We have done it. In our church work, we simply maintain that a Christian
church should stand ready to fellowship any one whom Christ fellowships, that
it should turn no one away because of his color, or because he, his father or
his mother was a slave. We maintain that there is no Christian reason
why there should be either State or local organizations of churches which
will not fellowship churches whose memberships differ in race. We seek
to establish churches and other institutions which dare interpret Christianity
as Christ taught it, and which will not yield a Christian principle for
enlarged statistics. There are caste churches enough in the South. No
more are needed. If Congregationalism can go there true to its history,
true to its real convictions, true to that gospel which successfully faced the
bitter prejudices of Jew and Gentile with the broad invitation, "Whosoever
will, may come," then it goes to become a mighty power and to win both a
place for itself and other churches, in time, to accept the same broad interpretation
of Christianity.</p>

<p>This Association has faith in the power of the gospel, and, under the
reign of God, of the final triumph of the right. It is willing to enter the
<a name="page311" id="page311"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 311]</span>
doors now so wide open for missionary work, and to wait, if need be, for
that glory of the denomination, which is better than long tables of statistics,
the glory of adhering to the right.</p>

<p>The time has now come when our church work can be greatly enlarged.
Our schools have been doing their work, and scattering all through the
South those who have learned what pure religion and spiritual worship
mean, and they are ready and longing for something better than they find
within their reach. We can now push our work as fast as the churches of
the North will furnish the money. We most earnestly appeal for the means
to enable us to greatly develop, during the coming year, this department of
the work.</p>


<h4>CHURCH WORK AMONG NEW SETTLERS IN THE SOUTH.</h4>

<p>Wonderful and more wonderful tales are now reaching the world of the
unlimited resources of the South. They are a new discovery even to the
South itself. These stories of lumber and mineral wealth are turning the
tide thitherward. Towns and cities are beginning to spring up as they
have in the West, and both great need and rich opportunity call for immediate
missionary work. This new population is mostly, as yet, from the
North, though many from Wales, especially miners, and from other countries
of the old world are beginning to come in. In the new towns they find no
churches, in the old towns few whose ideas and customs can satisfy their
minds and hearts. Here is a great opportunity. We can aid these people
to establish churches which will emphasize that interpretation of the
Gospel which we believe to be Christian.</p>

<p>In Florida, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee we have already aided
in establishing such churches which have connected themselves&mdash;and
gladly so&mdash;with the regular State organizations of Congregational churches.
No direful results have followed. No fanaticism is in it. It is simply
doing the thing that is right and Christian. May such churches continue
to multiply in the "New South" and help to make it <i>new</i> indeed.</p>

<h3><i>THE MOUNTAIN WORK.</i></h3>

<p>Notwithstanding all the interest that has been manifested in our mountain
work, we feel sure that the churches do not realize the magnitude of
this field, the pressing needs of this people in the heart of our country, the
wonderful opportunities before us, and the heart-stirring results already
secured.</p>

<p><a name="page312" id="page312"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 312]</span>
Large portions of seven States&mdash;three or four hundred counties&mdash;with
a population of between two and three millions, claim our attention and
call for our work. Here is a country of untold natural resources. Here
is a people of good blood. Men of power have come from among them,
and shown of what they are capable. Side by side with the Northern soldiers
these mountaineers fought for the Union, or suffered in prisons rather
than fight against it. Where our schools and churches have been established,
men and women of worth and ability have stepped out and become
strong helpers in building up new institutions. But away from these institutions
and out of touch with the life of the towns, we find a class of people
whose condition in itself is a Macedonian cry. Their windowless,
stoveless, comfortless log cabins; their so-called schools, in which on the
roughest benches conceivable, and without a desk, a slate, or a blackboard,
with a teacher with unkempt hair, ragged and dirty clothes, possibly
bare feet, who perhaps can scarcely read, the children study at the
top of their voices&mdash;<i>blab</i> schools they call them&mdash;have for their course of
study the spelling book alone, and are taught that a word is correctly spelled
when all the letters are named, no matter in what order; their so-called
churches, with perhaps a monthly meeting during the summer months, without
Sunday-school, prayer meeting, or any form of church work, without
morality as a requisite of church membership, with an illiterate ministry&mdash;a
large number of the ministers cannot read even, and what is worse in many
cases are drunken, impure, and in every way immoral; their children so
easily gathered into day-schools and Sunday-schools, and so responsive to the
work done for them&mdash;all these things appeal to us with pathetic power.
Perhaps no missionary work ever showed greater results in so short a time
than those obtained in these mountains.</p>

<p>We have here in two States eleven schools and twenty-two churches.
Earnest calls have come to us to begin work in North Carolina and Alabama.
We feel sure that if the churches could hear these appeals they would bid us
respond. We have promised to begin work the coming year in these States,
and we must look to the churches to furnish us the means. New lumbering
and mining towns are springing up in this mountain country, and immediate
missionary work is their only hope. A single one of these new towns, scarcely
half-a-dozen years old, has had already more than a hundred men shot in it,
and this awful work still goes on. This marvelously rich mineral region is sure
to be filled in the near future with these mining towns, and unless the Christian
work keeps pace with this kind of growth, this large territory will
become notorious for bloody scenes as no portion of our land has ever
been. Now is the time to preempt the country for Christ, by planting at
strategic points the church and the Christian school, and through them to
send forth to every part the pure, restraining and elevating influences of
the gospel. God's call to us to do this work is loud and clear. Can we be
faithful to Him and refuse to obey?</p>

<hr />
<a name="page313" id="page313"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 313]</span>


<h3>THE INDIANS.</h3>

<p>There are 260,000 Indians in this country. Compared with our great
fields in the South, this is small. But there is an emphasis on this work
which is not made by figures. Those who were native to this land have
been made foreigners. Those who were the first to receive missionary
work here, and who responded as readily as any heathen people ever did,
are still largely pagans. While one Christian has been telling the Indians
the story of the gospel, another calling himself a Christian has been shooting
them. They have not yet had a full chance to learn what Christianity
is. From place to place they have been pushed so that they have not had
time to build their altars to the true God. We have wronged them and we
owe them more than we shall pay. We shall meet our obligations but in
part, when we do all we can to save them.</p>

<p>We have in bur Indian work eighteen schools and six churches, one
new church having been added this year. In these, 68 missionaries have
been doing noble service for the Indian and for the country. Shall the
Indian problem forever perplex and shame both the country and the
Church? Will not the churches enable us to send all the workers and do
all the work needed to be done, and thus hasten the day when it can be
joyfully proclaimed that the Indians are evangelized&mdash;no longer pagans
and foreigners, but our fellow Christians and our fellow citizens?</p>

<h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>

<p>At our Annual Meeting in 1887 we were urged to bring the attention of
the churches to this their phenomenal opportunity and duty, to give the
gospel at short range and nominal cost to Asia's millions, and to support
their hopeful and fruitful mission with all possible sympathy and aid.
Again, in 1888, the need of immediate and great re-enforcement and
enlargement was urged upon us.</p>

<p>Sixteen missions have been in operation during the year, and in them
thirty-five workers, ten of them Chinese, have been employed. 1,380 have
<a name="page314" id="page314"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 314]</span>
been enrolled as pupils in our schools&mdash;249 more than last year. 40 have
this year come out of heathenism into Christianity, and the whole number
who have confessed Christ in these missions and have been received as true
converts is above 750. This means much for the Chinese in this country,
and it means missionaries for China as well.</p>

<hr />


<h3>ENLARGEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>

<p>Extensive building and improvements have been called for this year.
At Lexington, Ky., the Chandler Normal School building is nearly completed
at a cost of $15,000&mdash;the gift of Mrs. Chandler. At Williamsburg,
Ky., thirteen acres of land have been secured for the enlargement of our
very successful school there and the large industrial building moved upon it.
$2,300 of the expense for this was paid by our generous friend, Mr. Stephen
Ballard, of Brooklyn, N.Y. The increasing number of boarders at this institution
has made necessary a new and larger dining room and kitchen,
which have been built.</p>

<p>At Nashville, Tenn., a commodious two-story building of modern
architecture, with rooms for physical culture and industrial training, has
been erected.</p>

<p>At Memphis, Tenn., the Le Moyne school building, which in the winter
was partially destroyed by fire, has been restored by the insurance.</p>

<p>At Knoxville, Tenn., the old church building, which was unfit for use,
has been built over and a parsonage added, making a neat and convenient
place of worship, and a home for the minister.</p>

<p>At Jellico, Tenn., the building used for church and school purposes has
been considerably enlarged to meet the wants of a large Sunday-school and
congregation.</p>

<p>At Grand View, Tenn., a new building has been put up for school and
dormitory purposes.</p>

<p>At Pleasant Hill, Tenn., a large three-story Girls' Hall is in process of
construction to enable the mountain girls to take advantage of this successful
normal school.</p>

<p>At Pine Mountain, Tenn., the church building has been completed and
furnished for school as well as church purposes and a teachers' home has
been built.</p>

<p>At Beaufort, N.C., the large old school building known as Washburn
Seminary, has been placed in the hands of the Association and refitted and
a new normal school started in it. The church building, also, has received
many greatly needed repairs.</p>

<p>At Chapel Hill, N.C., a brick church building, formerly belonging to
the Southern Methodists, has been purchased for a school, and will be used
also for church services.</p>

<p>At Macon, Ga., the Ballard School building has been completed and
<a name="page315" id="page315"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 315]</span>
furnished at a cost of $14,000, and a Girls' Hall erected at a cost of
$7,500&mdash;two more generous gifts of Mr. Stephen Ballard, of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>At Savannah, Ga., extensive repairs have been made on the Beach Institute
building.</p>

<p>At Thomasville, Ga., the school facilities have been increased by moving
a school building in the town, to the Connecticut Industrial School.</p>

<p>At McIntosh, Ga., land and buildings have been bought for the enlargement
of this historic, successful and intensely interesting school.</p>

<p>At Woodville, Ga., the church and school building which had been
nearly wrecked, first by the Charleston earthquake and then by a cyclone,
has been made solid and comfortable.</p>

<p>At Byron, Ga., land has been bought and preparations have been made
for a church building.</p>

<p>At Fairbanks, Fla., a school building and lot worth $2,500 have been
given to us by Mrs. Merrill, of Bangor, Me., on condition that we maintain
a school there.</p>

<p>At Marion, Ala., we have refitted a large dwelling for a greatly needed
school building.</p>

<p>At New Decatur, Ala., a new church building is about completed.</p>

<p>At Tougaloo, Miss., the large Girls' Hall, owing to the peculiarities of
the soil&mdash;alluvium, 300 feet deep&mdash;unknown when it was built, had been
crushing its foundations into the ground until it was on the point of falling.
Our own missionary and student force lifted it up, put under it new foundations
and repaired it in every part. At a cost of between $4,000 and
$5,000, they saved a $15,000 building which engineers and contractors pronounced
a hopeless wreck.</p>

<p>At Jackson, Miss., our church has been nicely seated with new pews.</p>

<p>At Hammond, La., a new church building has been erected.</p>

<p>At Straight University, a new industrial building has been put up with
student labor, and a small greenhouse has been built. For a long time the need
of enlargement there has been felt, and a lot near the present buildings has
been bought, on which is to be a school house for the primary and intermediate
grades.</p>

<p>At the Fort Berthold Mission, North Dakota, a new church, school and
mission home building has been built and named the Moody Station, after
the giver of the money which built it; also a small church building at
Moody Station No. 2.</p>

<p>At Standing Rock a new school, church and mission building&mdash;called
after the donor, the Sankey Station&mdash;has been erected. At Fort Yates, we
report a new church building&mdash;the Darling Memorial.</p>

<p>These are the most important enlargements and improvements. Of
course, there are many other smaller ones throughout our large field.</p>

<h3>WOMAN'S WORK.</h3>

<p>Twenty-six Woman's State Organizations now co-operate with us in our
missionary work. Each year shows the increasing importance and helpfulness
of the Woman's Bureau. From it go counsel, help and inspiration to the lady
teachers in the field, and missionary news and helpful suggestions to the ladies
of the State Associations. Through it pass the sympathy and the help of the
earnest workers in the older churches to the earnest workers in our mission
churches and schools. The people for whom we labor cannot be saved
either for this world or the next, unless the women who make the homes are
lifted out of coarseness and vice, and taught true womanhood and womanly
duties and arts. The Woman's Bureau is a most potent factor in the work

<p>It is with devout gratitude to God that we present these figures, showing
that we have been enabled during the past year to meet all current expenditures,
to liquidate the indebtedness of last year and to show a balance of
over four thousand dollars now in the treasury. This result is not only
gratifying in respect to the past, but it is hopeful in respect to the future.
We trust the constituents of the Association, who are so deeply interested in
the success of the work entrusted to us, will see to it that the coming year
shall terminate as favorably as this.</p>


<h3>DANIEL HAND FUND.</h3>

<p>In addition to the above receipts, the Association has received from
Daniel Hand the munificent gift of one million eight hundred and ninety-four
dollars and twenty-five cents ($1,000,894.25) to be known as the Daniel
Hand Fund for The Education of Colored People. The income only
of this Fund is to be used. The amount received as income from this
Fund for the nine months to September 30, is $36,999.71. This amount is
not included in the current receipts stated above, but is a Special Fund and
has been appropriated under the terms and conditions of the Trust. From
this income we have not only aided more than three hundred students who
otherwise would not have had the privilege of attending any school, but have
also greatly enlarged our school accommodations at Chapel Hill and Beaufort,
N.C., Phoenix, S.C., Thomasville and McIntosh, Ga., Selma, Ala.,
and New Orleans, La. Another year will afford opportunities to a much
greater number of pupils, and will still further enlarge our school facilities
<a name="page317" id="page317"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 317]</span>
in the special lines of work contemplated by this gift. It was a noble gift
from a noble man and it will do a noble work.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of the Southern Negroes are still found in
the rural districts, where schools are few and far apart. It is expected that
the gift of Daniel Hand will take educational privileges to thousands of
these in the country and on the plantations, who but for this must have
lived as in the blackness of night.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It has been found that with the West ever growing, and Congregational
churches multiplying, the field of our Western District Secretary was too
large for him possibly to cover it all. Hence this immense district has
been divided, and another has been established with its centre at Cleveland,
Ohio. Rev. C.W. Hiatt, a graduate of Wheaton College and Oberlin
Seminary, has been placed in charge of this district, and has already entered
upon the work. We bespeak for him a hearty welcome from the
churches.</p>

<p>Prof. Edward S. Hall, a graduate of Amherst College and a teacher of
long and successful experience, has been chosen a Field Superintendent
for the Southern work, and entered upon his duties at the beginning of our
year.</p>

<p>We again make grateful acknowledgment of our indebtedness to the
American Bible Society for its grants of Bibles, and to the Congregational
Sunday-school and Publishing Society for its grants of books and lesson
helps, to our poorer churches and Sunday-schools.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>This much we report. But how little can figures and words present the
needs of these great fields. How little idea can they convey of the extent
of the work done by our earnest, self-sacrificing, faithful and able missionaries.</p>

<p>We turn from the past to the future. The work attempted and done is
great, the work unattempted and not done is far greater. Should every
church and individual in the land double last year's contribution this year,
we would be compelled still to leave greatly needed work undone. In view
of boundless opportunities, we can ask no less of the churches than that
which the recent National Council at Worcester recommended&mdash;five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) for the work of the coming year.
Brethren, with more prayer, more consecration and more self-denial let us
take up together this vast work and these difficult problems which God has
set before us.</p>

<h3>REVIEW OF THE YEAR.</h3>

<h5>BY REV. WM. C. POND, D.D.</h5>

<p>Our fiscal year ended August 31st. To a stranger looking on as I close
its accounts, there might be nothing visible but an array of figures "dry as
dust." But if that on-looker could count the heart-beats, as I draw near
to making up the balance, could watch the rising tide of feeling, could hear
the out-burst of thanksgiving sounding through the chambers of the soul,
and now and again breaking the silence of my study with the cry:&mdash;"What
shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits," he would realise that there
was something in those figures not so very dry. <i>All bills paid</i>, and even a
balance much larger than usual left to help out the too scant resources of
the new year! I find myself saying again and again: "How can this be?"
It looked so dark four months ago; it looks so bright to-day. God has
answered prayer, has been true to his promise, has changed to blessing the
stress that we were under by placing thus upon our work the seal of his
own and his people's approbation.</p>

<p>Sixteen missions have been in operation during the year, all but three
of them for the entire twelve months. Thirty-five workers have been employed,
ten of whom have been Chinese brethren. The months of labor
aggregate 354.</p>

<p>The total number who have been enrolled as pupils in our schools is
1,380. This is larger by 249 than the enrollment of the previous year, and
by 336 than that of the year before. The <i>average</i> membership month by
month was in the aggregate, 523; the average attendance, 319. These
numbers are also in excess of the corresponding ones in several previous
years. Among these members of our schools there are 211 that profess to
have ceased from idolatry, and 150 who are believed to be true disciples of
Christ. I cannot now state the exact number who have professed conversion
during the year, but I believe it to be about <i>forty</i>. If so, the total
number who have declared themselves to be Christians and have been accepted
as such by our brethren, is more than 750.</p>

<p>The expenditures have been $11,019, of which more than 1,600 came
from the Chinese themselves, while their offerings for mission work in China
and expenses met in connection with Christian work in California would
show a giving on their part of at least $2,500 during the year.</p>

<p>SOME OTHER TOKENS OF GOOD.&mdash;Our helper, Loo Quong, writes as
follows from Los Angeles under date of Sept. 20th: "Now I have some
good news to tell you this time. The first one is this, that <i>five</i> of our
brethren will receive their baptism on Sunday in the First Congregational
Church. I brought them all down to the church to be proved by the pastor
and the deacons, and they all gave their good testimonies to the satisfaction
<a name="page319" id="page319"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 319]</span>
of all. Dr. Hutchins [Rev. R.G. Hutchins, D.D., pastor] was so glad on
hearing this good news again. There will now be eleven Chinese members
among his white flock. He spoke very kind towards the Chinese and our
school in their prayer-meeting, as he always did so in his preaching." Another
item of good news is, that by an arrangement among the ladies of this
church, a reduction in the teaching force which I have been compelled to
make is to be made good by volunteer service, each lady giving one evening
in each week. I earnestly hope that this good example may be followed
in others of our churches.</p>

<p>At San Buenaventura the new mission house, finished several months
ago, gives great satisfaction. It is not the property of the Mission, but has
been built for it and is rented to us at cost. We can rely upon the use of
it as long as the work continues in that place,&mdash;that is, if the building lasts
so long. We were paying $12.00 per month for a low, ill-located and ill-built,
untidy shanty, yet the best place that could be had. We now pay
$8.00 per month for a neat, commodious building which furnishes not only
an attractive school-room, but living rooms also, for which our brethren pay
a small rent, and thus make for themselves something very like a Christian
home. Four of these brethren were recently baptised and received to the
Congregational Church.</p>

<p>No mention has yet been made in these columns of the new mission
house in Oakland which we hold by the same tenure as that at San Buenaventura.
It could not be better located, is a very neat structure, substantial
also, and planned expressly for our work. It, too, is rented to us at
cost. A hint of what goes on there, and of what goes <i>out</i> from there, aside
from the labors of the school, may be found in these few sentences from a
letter of Yong Jin: "One scholar promised to be Christian was two weeks
(i.e. two weeks ago), and he will join our Association to-night. I hope his
soul will be saved. I had preaching on the street last Sunday and before
last Sunday. I shall go next Sunday too. I hope you pray for me and this
school. May [may be] I can conquer the evil and bring more number to
the school and to the Association. I believe God has a great power."</p>

<h2>BUREAU OF WOMAN'S WORK.</h2>

<h5>MISS D.E. EMERSON, SECRETARY.</h5>

<p><span class="sc">We are glad</span> to see the State Organizations increasing. Now let every
one become a working Union, bringing funds into the treasury of the American
Missionary Association, toward meeting the imperative needs of its
Woman's Work, and we shall rejoice indeed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our Industrial Teachers</span> are heavily taxed just now in providing
sewing material for classes. We need basted patchwork, and basted under
garments for the sewing departments throughout the field, but especially
<a name="page320" id="page320"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 320]</span>
for Anniston and Mobile, Alabama; Memphis and Jonesboro, Tennessee;
Tougaloo, Mississippi; and Austin, Texas. One missionary writes, "I find
my classes very large. In beginning I have about one hundred girls in
sewing, about thirty in Household Economy and Cooking, and later I shall
have a large class in Nursing. This work added to the care of the Mission
Home will, I fear, be more than I can carry, unless I have help, and I do
not see how I can let one bit of the work stop. I am sure there are plenty
of good friends at the North who will gladly help when they know."</p>

<p><span class="sc">We have added</span> a special industrial teacher to the force in Trinity
School at Athens, Alabama. Miss Perkins writes: "I am charmed with the
school and the inside of the building. I wish each day that our Northern
friends could look in at Chapel. I think they would feel repaid in great
measure by the goodly sight. I was glad to find a Christian Endeavor
Society in the school, it seemed so like home."</p>

<h3>WOMAN'S WORK IN NORTH CAROLINA.</h3>

<h5>BY MISS A.E. FARRINGTON.</h5>

<p>On Thursday, Oct. 3d, a Woman's Missionary Union was organized for
the Congregational churches of North Carolina. A year ago, at the meeting
of the State Association in Wilmington, the subject was discussed, and
a committee was appointed to confer with the ladies of the churches in
regard to a local organization in each church. The plan met with favor,
and on coming together this year it was found that nearly every church
reported a missionary society in some form. All were therefore ready for the
State Union, when the Association of Congregational Churches convened in
the little country church at Oaks. As there was no chapel or church parlor to
be placed at the disposal of the ladies, they withdrew to the grove, and there
under the tall, symmetrical oaks by the veranda of the little mission home
of Miss Douglass, the organization was effected with the aid of Miss Emerson,
of New York, who was present.</p>

<p>The following evening a public meeting was held at which reports were
heard from the local societies. The dark countenances were light with
eager interest, as they listened to the account of the work done by the women.
One told of a society, organized in February with two members who
became President and Treasurer. The numbers soon increased to eight, all
of them hard-working women, one of them the mother of twelve children
for whom she found it difficult to provide, yet that society reported $10.61
as the result of their eight months' work.</p>

<p>Another reported a weekly Bible reading in connection with the Woman's
Society, at which one who could read took the Bible while others gathered
around, and "as they got to understand the Word" they spoke to one
another of the work of the Lord in their own hearts.</p>

<p>Report was made of a contribution to the Indian work at Fort Berthold,
<a name="page321" id="page321"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 321]</span>
also a quilt made by the little girls for a Christmas present to the Indian
children.</p>

<p>One society, embracing both home and foreign work, cared for the sick
and needy of its own church, and also sent contributions to Africa.</p>

<p>Knowing, as I do, the poverty of this people and the sacrifices they
make, I could but feel that if in the North there should be as ready and
proportionate a response, the treasury of the Lord would be overflowing.</p>

<p><b>THE NEW HYMN AND TUNE BOOK</b></p>

<p>FOR EVANGELICAL CHURCHES.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>COMMENDATIONS.</p>

<p>Messrs. A.S. Barnes &amp; Co. publish a great variety of valuable works. There is
nothing better in the line of hymn books than their "Carmina Sanctorum," edited by
Zachary Eddy, Lewis Ward Mudge and the late Dr. Roswell Dwight Hitchcock.
This book of sacred song has already been adopted by over <b><i>400 Churches</i></b> of
different denominations&mdash;<i>The New York Observer</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Any congregation that likes to have its hymnal represent careful thought and full
culture, would do well to examine this collection of "Carmina Sanctorum," recently
published by A.S. Barnes &amp; Co. The editors have taken it for granted that choirs and
congregations are desiring, not revolution, but only improvement in their service of
song, <i>i.e.</i>&mdash;the plan is conservative, but not narrowly so. It represents the great
communion of saints of all ages and nations. All corners of the vast hymnic field have
been drawn on.&mdash;<i>The Independent, New York</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Carmina Sanctorum" contains 746 hymns, 21 doxologies, 43 chants, 450 tunes and
7 separate indexes. The hymns are only the choicest, and they have been carefully
edited by that accomplished authority in hymnody, Dr. Hitchcock, who gives the date
and authorship of each hymn and notes all abbreviations and changes in each page.
The responses are selected from the revision and make a complete manual. The
cream of the old [tunes] is all here. The cream of the new is all here. <span class="sc">As The
AMERICAN CHURCHES HAVE GROWN IN TASTE AND CAPACITY FOR MUSICAL EXPRESSION IN
WORSHIP, THIS BOOK SEEMS TO MEET THEIR WANTS COMPLETELY, GIVING THEM PLENTY OF
TUNES, THEY CAN AND WILL SING, AND AT THE SAME TIME EDUCATING THEIR TASTE AND
IMPROVING THEIR PUBLIC WORSHIP</span>. It is also a pleasant feature that when new tunes
are furnished to certain hymns, the more familiar ones will be found on the same page.
To all this may be added that four editions are published, two with music and two
without, and they are all cheap.&mdash;<i>The New York Evangelist.</i></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
